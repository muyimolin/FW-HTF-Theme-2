volume = {23}, 
number = {10-11}, 
pages = {1013-1027}, 
year = {2004}, 
doi = {10.1177/0278364904047391}, 
abstract ={                 In this paper we present the system design of a machine that we have constructed                     to study a quadrupedal gallop gait. The gallop gait is the preferred high-speed                     gait of most cursorial quadrupeds. To gallop, an animal must generate ballistic                     trajectories with characteristic strong impacts, coordinate leg movements with                     asymmetric footfall phasing, and effectively use compliant members, all the                     while maintaining dynamic stability. In this paper we seek to further understand                     the primary biological features necessary for galloping by building and testing                     a robotic quadruped similar in size to a large goat or antelope. These features                     include high-speed actuation, energy storage, on-line learning control, and                     high-performance attitude sensing. Because body dynamics are primarily                     influenced by the impulses delivered by the legs, the successful design and                     control of single leg energetics is a major focus of this work. The leg stores                     energy during flight by adding tension to a spring acting across an articulated                     knee. During stance, the spring energy is quickly released using a novel capstan                     design. As a precursor to quadruped control, two intelligent strategies have                     been developed for verification on a one-legged system. The Levenberg-Marquardt                     on-line learning method is applied to a simple heuristic controller and provides                     good control over height and forward velocity. Direct adaptive fuzzy control,                     which requires no system modeling but is more computationally expensive,                     exhibits better response. Using these techniques we have been successful in                     operating one leg at speeds necessary for a dynamic gallop of a machine of this                     scale. Another necessary component of quadruped locomotion is high-resolution                     and high-bandwidth attitude sensing. The large ground impact accelerations,                     which cause problems for any single traditional sensor, are overcome through the                     use of an inertial sensing approach using updates from optical sensors and                     vehicle kinematics.             },

abstract ={The Mars rover Opportunity has explored Victoria crater, a ~750-meter eroded impact crater formed in sulfate-rich sedimentary rocks. Impact-related stratigraphy is preserved in the crater walls, and meteoritic debris is present near the crater rim. The size of hematite-rich concretions decreases up-section, documenting variation in the intensity of groundwater processes. Layering in the crater walls preserves evidence of ancient wind-blown dunes. Compositional variations with depth mimic those ~6 kilometers to the north and demonstrate that water-induced alteration at Meridiani Planum was regional in scope.},

abstract ={A new approach for climbing hard vertical surfaces has been developed that allows a                 robot to scale concrete, stucco, brick and masonry walls without using suction or                 adhesives.The approach is inspired by the mechanisms observed in some climbing                 insects and spiders and involves arrays of microspines that catch on surface                 asperities. The arrays are located on the toes of the robot and consist of a tuned,                 multi-link compliant suspension. The fundamental issues of spine allometric scaling                 versus surface roughness are discussed and the interaction between spines and                 surfaces is modeled. The toe suspension properties needed to maximize the                 probability that each spine will find a useable surface irregularity and to                 distribute climbing loads among many spines are detailed. The principles are                 demonstrated with a new climbing robot, SpinybotII, that can scale a wide range of                 flat exterior walls, carry a payload equal to its own weight, and cling without                 consuming power. The paper also reports how toe parameters scale with robot mass and                 how spines have also been used successfully on the larger RiSE robot.},
